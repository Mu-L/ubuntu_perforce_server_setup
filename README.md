# Ubuntu Perforce server setup script

This bash script will setup Perforce a good 90% of the way. Running all the commands you need to run it. Making it nice and easy to get setup and working.

## Why?

I had a few clients who wanted it setup and it was the same commands over and over again, so a quick bash script and now its easier than ever.

## Limitations
- Ubuntu based only - I tried to get it working on Debian what I normally use but either packages weren't available or they were out of date. Without a lot of messing around updating sources its just easier to use Ubuntu for now.
